Pius's feedback on main branch as of 6/7, afternoon.
===

Requirements:
- Front end client runs, but backend doesn't start, has errors
- What's the deployment plan, for at least CD?
- Front end doesn't access data yet -- doesn't have to be complex/pretty but should be usable

Logic:
- Backend server has errors starting Sequelize, with a "duplicate column name error" for "userId" -- your models don't need that "userId" property to directly link a Task or Note with a user, because Sequelize will automatically link them when you make associations.  So it looks like that error comes from Sequelize trying to duplicate that foreign key. (see suggested edits to models)

Testing:
- What API endpoints can be tested?  Auth not implemented, so just use Postman?
- Is there starting seed data?

Style:
- Recommend README document details on API, deployed site, local install
