#### I Want to Use the Site
##### Great! The site has been deployed using Railway & the link is here: https://taskmaster-notes-app-production.up.railway.app/api/users - PLEASE NOTE: This is a WIP and Deploying locally will yield best results
* Take a look around, as a User you are able to create tasks with titles and descriptions of your choice, assign due dates to them, and keep track of your progress.
* You are able to use Taskmaster Notes as a note-taking app as well. Simply start a new note and wrtie away! If you prefer, you are also able to add notes to specific tasks so you can keep track of progress.
